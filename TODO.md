So, maybe the socket.http module supports https?

## Super Simple

- Weather App
- Music App
- Notepad App

## Super Complex

- VsCode Clone (Not 100%, but good enough)
- Maybe Google Fonts Integration? (Just maybe...)
- Connect databases? (SQL?)

**Also need to add more features to the current examples and check for errors.**
